##Red Leaf Store Policies & Warranty Information

Here at Red Leaf IT Asset Recovery, our top priority is customer service, and every effort will be made to satisfy you in a fair and reasonable manner. If you feel you are not being treated in this manner, please ask for the owner.

###Standard 90 Day Warranty/Satisfaction Guarantee on Refurbished Computers

Within 90 days of purchase, if you're not happy with your purchase, bring it back for an exchange or full refund. Item must be in exact condition in which it was sold. See our posted Return Policy for questions on what can and cannot be returned.

###Standard 1-year Parts warranty on new Parts
Red Leaf will warranty most replacement/service parts for 1 year from the date of purchase.
If, during the 1-year warranty period, a part needs to be repaired or replaced, Red Leaf, at its sole discretion, will either replace or repair the part. If it is within 90 days of your purchase date, we will replace the item with an identical or equivalent item in stock assuming such an item is available. If the replacement part needed is not available, one may be ordered at our discretion to be installed into the machine.

It can take anywhere from 1 – 4 weeks for parts replacement orders, depending on the supplier/manufacturer of an item. When an item is replaced under warranty, the repaired/replaced part will include only the warranty from the part seller, no warranty is given by Red Leaf on the replacement part itself.

###Warranty Policy for Hardware Repair Work Performed
Hardware repairs performed at Red Leaf such as hard drive replacements, newly installed parts, etc. come with a standard 90-day warranty unless otherwise stated. This warranty covers the labor performed during the warranty period. Red Leaf doesn't offer warranties on ordered service/replacement parts.

###Warranty Policy for Software Repair Work Performed
Red Leaf only offers a small amount of Software Service. Those sevices are warrantied for 7 days. In the event that Windows Update or a malware infection causes the need for software repair, Red Leaf will charge the current posted labor fee to repair the system's software.

###Why Doesn’t Your System Warranty Cover Software Problems?
Malware – Malware is everywhere and is easily contracted on Windows machines. Even when the virus is removed there still may be damage that can only be repaired by erasing your hard drive and reinstalling Windows all of your software. For this reason, we cannot cover these types of problems under warranty.

###Corruption 
Data corruption of software can occur from power surges, improper computer shutdown, bugs in software, viruses, malware or even during installation of a new program. Again, these issues are not the result of a defect in the computer that can be corrected by replacing any of the hardware components of the system and for this reason, we cannot warranty such problems.

###Bugs
Many software programs, even those from large companies like Microsoft have bugs. Since we do not have access to the software’s source code we cannot correct bugs in software. Only future updates where the manufacturer fixes the bugs can correct these types of problems. In the event that a Windows Update is determined to be the cause of a needed repair, Red Leaf will charge the posted labor rate to repair a Windows Installation.

###Surge Protection
Your computer’s warranty does not cover damage by acts of nature, power surges, or any other power related problems. Please use a good quality surge protector.

Many people are unaware that surge protectors have a finite lifespan. At some point, your surge protector will stop protecting your gear from power surges and become an ordinary power strip.

###Accidental damage

Items that are damaged by the customer while in their possession are inelligible for return.

###Other Notes

- Items that contain consumables
	- Consumables sold along with items are not covered under Red Leaf's warranty or exchange. Examples are toner, ink, printer/scanner rollers, labels, paper, etc.
- Issues deemed purely cosmetic
	- Cosmetic issues that computers might have or develop will not be corrected under our warranty. Items that were sold with an original cosmetic issue are still eligible for return/exchange.
