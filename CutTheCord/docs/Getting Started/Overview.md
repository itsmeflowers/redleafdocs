### General Overview

Cut the Cord isn't a piece of hardware, it's not something tangible you can buy. **It's a concept.**

Imagine enjoying the content you like, whenever you want to enjoy it, on any device with an internet connection.

It's kind of like running your own Netflix, or Spotify...

Basically, you're in control of your media: your movies, your music, your TV, all at the tip of your finger.

It's a pretty cool concept, right? Let's dive a little deeper.

### The Old Model

For the longest time (and still to this day), most forms of entertainment are owned by large corporations and they control what is on and when.

Consider your average cable TV provider for example. Before the dawn of the DVR, subscribers were forced to watch their schedule of programming when it came on TV.

Once DVR arrived, you still could only watch what you wanted AFTER it came on the air.

DVR became extremely popular. It also lead to lots and lots of extra fees the providers could charge for leasing hardware to their customers. 

Later, many providers started providing an "On Demand" service where certain programs can be watched at any time, whether or not they have been recorded. Some of these movies also have a fee to watch or "rent".

Imagine combining the best parts of DVR and On Demand and you're starting to get an idea of where we're going with our Cut the Cord offering.

Using the power of PLEX, you run your own entertainment cloud!

### Take back control of your entertainment

Why let these giant corporations drain your wallet by charging hundreds of dollars a month for thousands of channels you can't possibly watch?

By allowing us to help you Cut the Cord, you'll start seeing that there's much better content available from hundreds of other sources than your TV Provider. Why be limited?
