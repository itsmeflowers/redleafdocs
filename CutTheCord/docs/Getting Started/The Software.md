##Experience makes the difference

We're PLEX experts and we've used it for years across lots of different networks and configurations. We'll take care of the nitty gritty settings to make your installation purr.

We also specialize in refurbishing computer hardware at Red Leaf. If you've got a spare computer and want to configure it for Cut the Cord, bring it along and we can check it out.
