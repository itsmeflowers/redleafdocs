##Time to plug in the server

If you've bought one of our Cut the Cord boxes, it's time to get it all plugged in.

You'll need the cables we supplied (or the ones you're using from your stash) so grab those.

##Choosing a spot for your server

If you've decided where the server is going to live you can skip this section, if not, keep reading on.

If you're not plugging your computer into your TV directly to use as a display, you'll need to track down the monitor you're going to use with the computer and connect it to power and the computer.

Once the monitor is connected and powered up, it's time to plug in all the connections for the computer.

Connect at least the following connections to the computer:

- Video connection for monitor
- Power connection for the computer
- Ethernet wired connection for internet (not needed for wireless)
- Keyboard and mouse for controlling the server
- Over-the-air antenna into the TV tuner (if purchased with the box)

Time to power up the box!
