##Add the server to your Plex account

To add the server to your Plex account, we'll need to open the Plex Server app that starts automatically with Windows.

You can find it in the Windows System Tray as shown in the screenshot below:

Right click on the icon and click Open Plex...

Once the window finishes loading, click on the Settings Icon at the top right and you should see a screen that looks like this:

Click the Claim Server option

You'll then be asked to sign into Plex again, so use the same email and password from the last step to add your account to this server.

Congratulations! Your Plex Server is signed in!
